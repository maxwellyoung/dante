## High-Concept Pitch

A tiny, tight, symbolic micro-Metroidvania, "Infernal Ascent" is a poetic and punchy platformer where you climb the celestial ladder _backwards_.

## Core Experience

The player begins all-powerful in Paradiso and descends through the circles of Inferno, losing a core ability at each transition. Grace is subtraction. The goal is to create a feeling of melancholy empowerment, where becoming "weaker" makes the player smarter, more creative, and more attuned to the world's design.

## Design Pillars

1.  **Tactile, Perfect Controls:** The player's movement is the primary verb. Every jump, dash, and step must feel responsive and satisfying. If the controls aren't perfect, nothing else matters.

    - _Inspiration: Celeste, Super Mario, Vlambeer_

2.  **A Dense, Unfolding World:** The world is the main character. Each circle is a single, interconnected screen (or small series of screens) filled with secrets, shortcuts, and non-obvious paths. The level design is the puzzle.

    - _Inspiration: Animal Well, Fez_

3.  **Narrative Through Mechanics:** The story is told through the player's loss of abilities. We don't rely on heavy exposition. The environment, the cryptic tercets from NPCs, and the player's own changing capabilities deliver the narrative payload.

    - _Inspiration: Thomas Was Alone, Journey_

4.  **Symbolic Challenge:** The game is difficult, but fair. Death is a quick reset to the start of the "canto," encouraging mastery through repetition. The challenge should feel intentional and tied to the theme of the circle (e.g., temptation in Lust, frustration in Wrath).
