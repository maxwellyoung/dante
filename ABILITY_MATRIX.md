# Ability-Loss Matrix

Based on the brutal design critique, this matrix outlines the core gameplay loop for the first four circles of Inferno. The goal is to ensure each loss of power is met with a compelling new environmental mechanic, creating fresh gameplay puzzles and reinforcing the game's central themes.

| Circle          | Removed Power         | New Environmental Hook                                                                                                                                                                                                | Emotional Beat                                                                                                                                                                     | Anticipated Player Skill-Test                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Lust**     | **Air Dash**          | **Temptation Winds:** Gusts of wind that push and pull the player. They must be ridden or fought against to navigate tight passages, replacing the instant control of the dash with a need to manage external forces. | **Loss of Control, Vulnerability:** The world now acts on you directly. A feeling of being tossed about by whims stronger than your own.                                           | **Timing & Momentum:** Mastering the wind's rhythm. Shifting from twitch reflexes (dash) to patience and reading the environment.                  |
| **2. Gluttony** | **Double Jump**       | **Goo Walls & Geysers:** Sticky, tar-like surfaces that can be slid down but not jumped off. Slimy geysers erupt periodically, launching the player upwards, replacing the lost verticality of the double jump.       | **Heaviness, Frustration:** Movement feels sluggish and constrained. Mistakes are more punishing without a "get out of jail free" jump. You feel mired in the filth of the circle. | **Route Planning & Commitment:** Using slides and geysers in combination. Planning paths ahead, as recovery from a missed jump is now much harder. |
| **3. Greed**    | **Projectile Attack** | **Cursed Gold Switches:** The player must now use the environment to progress. Cursed Gold can be picked up and thrown to hit switches, but it weighs the player down, reducing jump height and movement speed.       | **Helplessness, Cunning:** Direct confrontation is gone. Every enemy is a major threat. Forces a shift from aggression to intellect, observation, and puzzle-solving.              | **Puzzle-Platforming & Stealth:** Reading enemy patterns to sneak past. Using the weighty gold to solve traversal puzzles under pressure.          |
| **4. Wrath**    | **Wall Jump/Climb**   | **Rage Blocks & Boiling Rivers:** Brittle blocks shatter when the player falls on them from a significant height. Boiling blood rivers damage the player but also push them along at high speed.                      | **Anger, Impotence:** Inability to scale walls feels intensely restrictive. Forced into destructive, uncontrolled falls to progress. Using your own pain as a tool.                | **Environmental Destruction & Risk/Reward:** Identifying breakable paths and using damaging rivers for high-speed, risky traversal.                |
